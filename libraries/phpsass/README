NEW! Try it out online, alongside the ruby compiler: http://phpsass.fubhy.com/

This is fork of phamlp primarily for inclusiong as a Drupal pre-processor.
However, there is no Drupal-specific code and it will work for any PHP system.

This version of the compiler is NOT compatible with other forks of PHamlP, and
the name has been changed to reflect this. Please take a look at the "sassy"
module on Drupal.org for information on how to add frameworks and custom
functions. Docs will be coming when we aren't doing more important things.
